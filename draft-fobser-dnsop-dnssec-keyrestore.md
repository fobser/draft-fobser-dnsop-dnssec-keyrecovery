# Introduction

DNSSEC {{RFC9364}} uses public key cryptography to provide integrity
protection of DNS data. From an operational point of view, it is
critically important to keep the private key secret under all
circumstances.

The private key is typically kept secret by using Hardware Security
Modules (HSMs). HSMs are designed to perform cryptographic operations
such as creating keys and signing messages without disclosing the
private key. Alternatively the DNSSEC signer is an appliance or
commodity server hardware and operational policy stipulates that the
private key must not leave the signer.

Operationally this is a risk because only a single key exists. The
key could become inoperable at any point due to hardware failure,
natural disaster, operator error, or malicious action.

It is difficult to create backups of the private key. After all, the
system is designed to prevent backups. A compromise is usually reached
by using a secret sharing scheme, e.g. {{Shamir}}. The private key is
split into N pieces inside of the HSM, which are then distributed to
key share holders. In case the private key becomes inoperable, M out
of the N key share holders need to come together to restore the secret
key.

A key sharing scheme does not mitigate all risk. When
more than N-M key shares become unavailable a restore cannot be
performed, because not enough key shares are available. This is
particularly challenging in small to medium sized teams.

Unlike the private key, a DNSSEC signed zone can be considered public
data with its integrity protected by signatures. Signed zones can be
added to the normal, established backup procedures.

The rest of the document describes procedures on how to restore DNSSEC
signing functionality with only a backup of the signed zone available.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses DNS terminology from {{RFC9499}}.
DNSSEC key states and timeline related abbreviations are defined in
{{RFC7583}}.

The following additional definitions are used within this document.

Inoperable (private key):
: The private part of a DNSKEY appearing in the chain of trust of
  the zone that can no longer be used for signing. Causes include
  hardware failure, natural disaster, operator error, or malicious
  action. A compromised key is not an inoperable private key since it
  can still be used for signing.

Operable (private key):
: The opposite of an inoperable private key. A key that can be used
  for signing.

# Scope

The procedures described in this document pertain to DNSSEC architectures
with pre-signed records. Online signing, such as described in {{RFC9824}},
is out of scope since it requires that each server carrying the zone holds
a copy of the signing key(s). Thus, the operational challenges are different
than described in the introduction.

The root zone is out of scope since the distribution of a new trust
anchor takes considerably longer than the RRSIG lifetime {{RFC7958}}.

Algorithm Rollovers as described in {{RFC6781}}, section 4.1.4 are out of
scope as well. They are already complicated enough and trying to recover
from an inoperable DNSSEC private key while an algorithm rollover is being
performed is unlikely to be successful.

If the inoperable DNSSEC private key uses an old or deprecated
algorithm, the procedures defined in this document cannot be used to
perform an algorithm rollover. Instead the procedures defined in this
document SHOULD be followed to first restore signing with the old
algorithm. Once this has been completed a regular algorithm rollover
can be performed.

Regular key rollovers are in scope, since they do not pose extra
challenges. The procedures described in this document effectively
cancel a potentially ongoing key rollover and perform a new one.

# DNSSEC Key Restore

In case of a catastrophe where the DNSSEC private key becomes
inoperable and no functioning backups of the private key are
available, it is desirable to recover from this situation with DNS
resolution continuing to work for the effected zone(s) while
performing DNSSEC key restore operations.

This is possible because the moment the DNSSEC private key becomes
inoperable, the zone is still correctly signed and served by the
authoritative name servers. Signatures typically have a lifetime of
many days. That means that the operator has a lot of time to recover
from this situation without the zone becoming bogus and no longer
validating. Hasty and inappropriate action on the other hand could
lead to outages.

While the DNSSEC private key cannot be restored because no functioning
backups exist, the function of the zone can be restored.

The restore process uses slightly modified key rollover procedures
from {{RFC7583}}.

During the restore process, the signing software operates on a
pre-signed zone. That is, the zone already contains a DNSKEY RRset and
RRSIG RRsets. The signing software might try to remove these records
because the accompanying private key is no longer present. The operator
MUST prevent this, otherwise the zone will become bogus.

The signing software MUST NOT remove DNSKEYs until instructed to do so
and SHOULD NOT remove old RRSIGs. If a signer implementation does
not support keeping the old RRSIG records in place these records,
excluding the RRSIG for the old DNSKEY RRset, MUST be manually added back
to the zone before publication.

The exact process depends on which key(s) are inoperable and if the
zone is signed with a split KSK / ZSK key pair or a Combined Signing
Key (CSK).

## KSK / ZSK split, KSK operable, ZSK inoperable

Since the old ZSK is inoperable, it cannot be used to create new
RRSIGs. Therefore the zone cannot be changed and only the Pre-Publication
method can be used. See {{RFC7583}} section 2.1.

Section 3.2.1 of {{RFC7583}} documents the timeline for this
method.

The following diagram shows the timeline of the restoration.
Time increases along the horizontal scale from left to right and the vertical
lines indicate events in the process. Significant times and time intervals
are marked.

                  |1|      |2|   |3|      |4|
                   |        |     |        |
    Key N         - - ----------->|<-Iret->|
                   |        |     |        |
    Key N+1        |<-Ipub->|<--->|<----- - -
                   |        |     |        |
    Key N                                 Trem
    Key N+1        Tpub    Trdy  Tact

                      ---- Time ---->

Event 1: The new ZSK is added to the DNSKEY RRset at its publication time
(Tpub).

The inoperable ZSK and all RRSIGs it created MUST remain in the zone.

The new ZSK must be published long enough to guarantee that any cached
DNSKEY RRset contains the new ZSK. This interval is the publication
interval (Ipub), given by

    Ipub = Dprp + TTLkey

Dprp is the propagation delay, the time it takes for changes to
propagate to all authoritative nameserver instances. TTLkey is the TTL
of the DNSKEY RRset.

Event 2: The new ZSK can be used when it becomes ready at Trdy.

    Trdy = Tpub + Ipub.

At this point the zone can be changed again.

Event 3: At some later time, the zone is signed with the new ZSK. At this
point RRSIGs from the inoperable ZSK can be removed. The inoperable ZSK
MUST be retained in the DNSKEY RRset.

Event 4: The inoperable ZSK can be removed after the retire interval (Iret).

    Iret = Dsgn + Dprp + TTLsig

Dsgn is the delay needed to ensure that all existing RRsets are signed
with the new ZSK, Dprp is the propagation delay and TTLsig is the
maximum TTL of all RRSIG records.

Theoretically the Double-Signature method could be used as well. In this case
records in the zone can only be changed after the retire interval, which is at
least as long as the publication interval of the Pre-Publication
method. The Double-Signature retire interval is given by:

    Iret = Dsgn + Dprp + max(TTLkey, TTLsig)

## KSK / ZSK split, KSK inoperable

Since the old KSK is inoperable, the DNSKEY RRset cannot be
changed. Therefore, only the Double-DS method can be used. See
{{RFC7583}} section 2.2.

If the ZSK is inoperable as well, it MUST NOT be restored yet.

Section 3.3.2 of {{RFC7583}} documents the timeline for this
method.

The following diagram shows the timeline of the restoration.
The diagram follows the convention described in Section 4.1.

                |1|      |2|       |3|  |4|      |5|
                 |        |         |    |        |
    Key N       - ---------------------->|<-Iret->|
                 |        |         |    |        |
    Key N+1      |<-Dreg->|<-IpubP->|<-->|<------- -
                 |        |         |    |        |
    Key N                                        Trem
    Key N+1     Tsbm     Tpub      Trdy Tact

                     ---- Time ---->

Event 1: A new DS record is added to the DS RRset in the parent
zone, this is the submission time, Tsbm.

Event 2: After the registration delay, Dreg, the DS record is
published in the parent zone. This is the publication time (Tpub).

    Tpub = Tsbm + Dreg.

The DS record must be published long enough to guarantee that any
cached DS RRset contains the new DS record. This is the parent
publication interval (IpubP).

    IpubP = DprpP + TTLds

DprpP is the propagation delay of the parent zone, i.e. the time it
takes for changes to propagate to all authoritative servers of the
parent zone. TTLds is the TTL of the DS RRset at the parent.

Event 3: The new KSK can be used when it becomes ready at Trdy.

    Trdy = Tpub + IpubP

Event 4: At this point, Tact, the new KSK is added to the DNSKEY
RRset and used to generate the DNSKEY RRsig. The old, inoperable
KSK can be removed. The ZSK MUST remain in the DNSKEY RRset.

If the ZSK is inoperable, the ZSK signing function can be now be
restored using the procedure in the previous section.

To ensure that no caches have DNSKEY RRset with the old KSK, the old
DS record MUST remain in the parent zone for the duration of the
retire interval (Iret), given by:

    Iret = DprpC + TTLkey

DprpC is the child propagation delay, the time it takes for changes to
propagate to all authoritative nameserver instances of the child
zone. TTLkey is the TTL of the DNSKEY RRset.

Event 5: The old DS record can be removed from the parent zone at Trem.

    Trem = Tact + Iret

## CSK inoperable

Since the old CSK is inoperable, the DNSKEY RRset cannot be
changed. Therefore, only the Double-DS method can be used. See
{{RFC7583}} section 2.2.

Section 3.3.2 of {{RFC7583}} documents the timeline for this method.

Since the CSK is also used to sign the zone, the timing of the
Double-DS method needs to be adjusted.

The inoperable CSK and all RRSIGs it created MUST remain in the zone.

The following diagram shows the timeline of the restoration.
The diagram follows the convention described in Section 4.1.

                |1|      |2|       |3|  |4|      |5|
                 |        |         |    |        |
    Key N       - ---------------------->|<-Iret->|
                 |        |         |    |        |
    Key N+1      |<-Dreg->|<-IpubP->|<-->|<------- -
                 |        |         |    |        |
    Key N                                        Trem
    Key N+1     Tsbm     Tpub      Trdy Tact

                     ---- Time ---->

Event 1: A new DS record is added to the DS RRset in the parent zone,
this is the submission time, Tsbm.

Event 2: After the registration delay, Dreg, the DS record is published
in the parent zone. This is the publication time (Tpub).

    Tpub = Tsbm + Dreg.

The DS record must be published long enough to guarantee that any
cached DS RRset contains the new DS record. This is the parent
publication interval (IpubP) given by

    IpubP = DprpP + TTLds

DprpP is the propagation delay of the parent zone, i.e. the time it
takes for changes to propagate to all authoritative servers of the
parent zone. TTLds is the TTL of the DS RRset at the parent.

Event 3: The new CSK can be used when it becomes ready at Trdy.

    Trdy = Tpub + IpubP

Event 4: At this point the new CSK is added to the DNSKEY RRset and
used to generate the DNSKEY RRsig. The old, inoperable CSK MUST remain
in the DNSKEY RRset. The new CSK can be used to generate the RRsigs for
the rest of the zone. The RRSIGs generated by the inoperable CSK MUST
remain in the zone.

To ensure that no caches have DNSKEY RRset with the old CSK, the old
DS record MUST remain in the parent zone for the duration of the
retire interval (Iret), given by:

    Iret = Dsgn + DprpC + max(TTLkey, TTLsig)

Dsgn is the delay needed to ensure that all existing RRsets are signed
with the new CSK. DprpC is the child propagation delay, the time it
takes for changes to propagate to all authoritative nameserver
instances of the child zone. TTLkey is the TTL of the DNSKEY RRset and
TTLsig is the maximum TTL of all RRSIG records.

Event 5: The old DS record can be removed from the parent zone at Trem.

    Trem = Tact + Iret

At the same time the old, inoperable CSK and all its signatures can be
removed as well.
